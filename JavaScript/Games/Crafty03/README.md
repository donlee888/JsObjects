============

Note the presence of StartJasmine.js in Source. I am now
separating the code for starting Jasmine from the tests
themselves.

Karma is working for these tests;

- npm install
- karma start

then look at the command line, or read **test_results.xml**

Notice that in the test, we completely mock Crafty.
