<h1>I'm the File From Folder02</h1>

<p>Look at the address bar. It says I'm in the directory <strong>FakeRoute</strong>. But I'm not. 
I live in <strong>Folder02</strong>: </p>
<pre>
../Folder02/Other.html
</pre>

<p>Our call to <strong>app.use</strong> reroutes the call to FakeRoute to the real directory, but no one
on the client side would have a way to know it is happening.</p>

<p><a href="/index.html">Now load index.html,</a>  but don't include Public in its path. We would
think this call should fail, since index.html is in this directory:</p>

<pre>
../Public/index.html
</pre>

<p>But the call succeeds because of the way we employed <strong>app.use</strong>.
