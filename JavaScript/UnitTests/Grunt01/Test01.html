<h1 id="markdown-notes">Markdown Notes</h1>
<p>It is great if you are just writing normal prose, because you don't have to do anything special to mark up plain text. It makes the text that you are writing very readable. Text in HTML documents can be hard to read. If you are trying to compose sentences that make sense, it's nice not to have a lot of syntax around it. </p>
<p>Fortunately, it is simple to go from markdown to HTML. The actual technique you use varies from editor to editor, and from
tool to tool. But none of them are hard to use. That means you can write nice clean markdown, and still get HTML that you can use on the web: you get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>You can even include pictures. For instance, here is a picture of a beach:</p>
<p><img alt="My Danish Picture" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Danish_coast.JPG/320px-Danish_coast.JPG" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure01: Here is the Danish Coast</strong></p>
<p>Here is a nested list:</p>
<ul>
<li>One</li>
<li>Two<ul>
<li>Nested One</li>
<li>Nested Two</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Three</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a poem by Basho:</p>
<pre><code>The old pond
The frog jumps in
The sound of water
</code></pre>
<p>Here is a picture I took and store on Google+:</p>
