  <title>App.use in Node and Express</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>I'm the File in the Public Folder</h1>
<p>This program is designed to help you understand our calls to <strong>app.use</strong> in node programs
that use express. You'll need to right click and choose view source to fully understand what 
is happening. Also, be sure to watch the address bar.</p>
<p>We call <strong>app.use</strong> when serving up static pages, that is, when serving whole pages 
that don't need to be assembled. That is why there is a call to express.static: it is telling express 
how to process static pages.</p>

<p>Here are the two <strong>app.use</strong> statements in our node server.js file for this program:</p>

<pre>
app.use("/", express.static(__dirname + '/Public'));
app.use("/FakeRoute", express.static(__dirname + '/Folder02'));
</pre>

<h2>The First Parameter Defaults to the Root</h2>
<p>By default, app.use assumes the first parameter is a slash : '/'. Thus these 
statements are identical:</p>

<pre>
app.use("/", express.static(__dirname + '/public');
app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public');
</pre>
<p>But we tend not to use the second case that uses the default. Instead, we use the syntax
shown in the first case, or variants of that syntax.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Links</h2>
<p>Let's try some real links to see first hand how it works.</p>

<p>Get <a href="/FakeRoute/Other.html">other.html</a>  from the fake route. Don't forget to watch the address bar! You might also want to look at the html, or the pseudo code shown below.</p>

<p><a href="/Folder02/Other.html">This will fail,</a> but click to see what happens when you try to 
get other.html from Folder02. The point is that <strong>Other.html</strong> really is in Folder02, but the call fails, because
of the way we set up the routes with <strong>app.use</strong>. </p>
<p><a href="/dirName">DirName</a> Click the DirName link to see what <strong>__dirname</strong> is set to on your system.</p>
<h2>The Pseudo Code</h2>
 <p>Here is pseudo code for the hrefs in our HTML. They can be used in lieu of viewing the HTML for this page: </p>
 <pre>
Get &lt;a href="/FakeRoute/Other.html">other.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="/Folder02/Other.html"&gt;This will fail,&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="/dirName"&gt;DirName&lt;/a&gt;
 </pre>
<hr>


<p>As you can see, they are set up so requests to localhost:30025/index.html will get the copy of index.html found
in the /Public directory. They also are set up to send requests to /FakeRoute to the /Folder02 directory.</p>

<h2>What Does the Disk Structure Look Like?</h2>
<p>Our real, on disk directory structure looks something like this:</p>

<pre>
05/10/2013  01:46 AM  &lt;DIR&gt;  Folder02
05/10/2013  01:36 AM  &lt;DIR&gt;  Public
</pre>

<p>In other words, there is no <strong>FakeRoute</strong> directory. It is fiction we created with the <strong>app.use</strong> statement.</p>

<h2>What is __dirname?</h2>
<p>__dirname is the directory where our server is running. Click the dirname link to see that directory.</p>
