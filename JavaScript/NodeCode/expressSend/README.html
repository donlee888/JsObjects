<h1 id="express-send">Express Send</h1>
<p>This is a &quot;hello world&quot; application for node and express.</p>
<h2 id="use-upstart-to-keep-your-program-in-memory">Use UpStart to Keep Your Program in Memory</h2>
<p>UpStart is a Linux utility that ships with recent Ubuntu releases. It can be used to ensure that your node servers or other program stay in memory even after you have closed your shell. It will even restart the programs automatically if the OS is rebooted.</p>
<p>Note that this project includes a file called <em>ExpressSend.config</em>. You can use this file to ensure that your application is launched when your OS boots, and that it will stay running, even if it temporarily crashes.</p>
<p>If you open ExpressSend.config in an editor, you will see a few portions of the line that begins with the word <em>exec</em> that you might want to edit. For instance, the line begins like this:</p>
<pre><code>exec /usr/bin/nodejs /home/charlie/ExpressSend/server.js</code></pre>
<p>If your version of the server is located elsewhere, then change the line as necessary. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>exec /usr/bin/nodejs /home/belinda/bin/server.js</code></pre>
<p>Note that I replaced <em>charlie/ExpressSend</em> with <em>belinda/bin</em>. You should edit your version of ExpressSend.config to reflect that paths and file names on your system.</p>
<p>Place ExpressSend.config in the /etc/init directory:</p>
<pre><code>/etc/init/ExpressSend.config</code></pre>
<p>The command to copy it to appropriate directory would be:</p>
<pre><code>cp ExpressSend.config /etc/init/.</code></pre>
<p>Once the file is in the <em>/etc/init</em> directory, you can start your program by typing the following:</p>
<pre><code>sudo start ExpressSend</code></pre>
<p>You can stop it with following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo stop ExpressSend</code></pre>
<p>When you reboot the system, your program will start automatically.</p>
<p>Error messages and other output from your program are recorded in the following location:</p>
<pre><code>/var/log/node.log </code></pre>
<p>If you examine the script, you can see that this file name is configurable.</p>
<p>You should create one script of this type for each program that you want to launch.</p>
