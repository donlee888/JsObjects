        <h1>Loading JavaScript</h1>
        
        <p>This example shows how to load a javascript file dynamically at run time. Here is
        	the file that does the loading:</p>
        <p><a href="index.js">index.js</a></p>
        <p>Here is the file that is loaded:</p>
        <p><a href="ScriptToLoad.js">ScriptToLoad.js</a></p>
        <p>As you can see, the file that is loaded does nothing more than change the background
        	color of the page. Note that loaded file is appended onto the end of the BODY
        	tag.</p>
