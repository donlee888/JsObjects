There are currently two examples:

-   Example 1: Web Application that loads an HTML file and uses it to insert
    data into index.html.

-   Example 2: Web application that loads an JSON file and uses it to insert
    data into index.html.

-   Example 3: A Cordova application that loads and HTML file and uses it to
    insert data into index.html.

In Example 3, there are two sections of code to look at:

-   The **bindEvents **method in index.js

-   The **changer **method in utility.js
