							<h2> John Adams </h2>

							<p> John Adams (October 30, 1735 (O.S. October 19, 1735)  - July 4, 1826) was the second president of the United States (1797-1801), having earlier served as the first vice president of the United States. An American Founding Father,[2] he was a statesman, diplomat, and a leading advocate of American independence from Great Britain. Well educated, he was an Enlightenment political theorist who promoted republicanism and wrote prolifically about his often seminal ideas, both in published works and in letters to his wife and key adviser Abigail as well as to other Founding Fathers. </p>

							<h2>Thomas Jefferson</h2>
							<p>Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743 (April 2, 1743 O.S.) - July 4, 1826) was an American Founding Father, the principal author of the Declaration of Independence (1776) and the third President of the United States (1801-1809). At the beginning of the American Revolution, he served in the Continental Congress, representing Virginia and then served as a wartime Governor of Virginia (1779-1781). Just after the war ended, from mid-1784 Jefferson served as a diplomat, stationed in Paris. In May 1785, he became the United States Minister to France. Jefferson was the first United States Secretary of State (1790-1793) serving under President George Washington. With his close friend James Madison he organized the Democratic-Republican Party, and subsequently resigned from Washington's cabinet. Elected Vice President in 1796, when he came in second to John Adams of the Federalists, Jefferson opposed Adams and with Madison secretly wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, which attempted to nullify the Alien and Sedition Acts. </p>

							<h2>James Madison</h2>
							<p>James Madison, Jr. (March 16, 1751 (O.S. March 5)  - June 28, 1836) was an American statesman and political theorist, the fourth President of the United States (1809-1817). He is hailed as the Father of the Constitution for being instrumental in the drafting of the United States Constitution and as the key champion and author of the United States Bill of Rights.[1] He served as a politician much of his adult life. Like other Virginia statesmen in the slave society,[2] he was a slaveholder and part of the lite; he inherited his plantation known as Montpelier, and owned hundreds of slaves during his lifetime to cultivate tobacco and other crops. </p>
