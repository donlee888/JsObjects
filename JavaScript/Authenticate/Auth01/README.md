OAuth Authentication
====================

There were two different techniques I was looking at to allow 
us to authenticate users when they sign in. The example in this 
directory implements an OAuth solution, and I ended up going 
with the OpenId solution. (Actually OAuth is now being built 
into OpenId, but it is easier to use in the OpenId solution.) 
At any rate, you can ignore the OAuth solution. The code in the 
Auth01 program is mostly just a demo that I found on the web, 
I'll need to sit down with it and do more work before we can 
discuss it in class. The other two programs in the Authenticate 
directory should work as is, and they relate to what we are 
doing in class.
